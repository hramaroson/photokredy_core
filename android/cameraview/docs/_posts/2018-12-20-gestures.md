`CameraView` listen to lots of different gestures inside its bounds. You have the chance to map
these gestures to particular actions or camera controls, using the `mapGesture()` method.
This lets you emulate typical behaviors in a single line:

```java
cameraView.mapGesture(Gesture.PINCH, GestureAction.ZOOM); // Pinch to zoom!
cameraView.mapGesture(Gesture.TAP, GestureAction.FOCUS_WITH_MARKER); // Tap to focus!
cameraView.mapGesture(Gesture.LONG_TAP, GestureAction.CAPTURE); // Long tap to shoot!
```

Simple as that. There are two things to be noted:

- Not every mapping is valid. For example, you can't control zoom with long taps, or start focusing by pinching.
- Some actions might not be supported by the sensor. Check out `CameraOptions` to know what's legit and what's not.

|Gesture|Description|Can be mapped to|
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
|`PINCH`|Pinch gesture, typically assigned to the zoom control.|`zoom` `exposureCorrection` `none`|
|`TAP`|Single tap gesture, typically assigned to the focus control.|`focus` `focusWithMarker` `capture` `none`|
|`LONG_TAP`|Long tap gesture.|`focus` `focusWithMarker` `capture` `none`|
|`SCROLL_HORIZONTAL`|Horizontal movement gesture.|`zoom` `exposureCorrection` `none`|
|`SCROLL_VERTICAL`|Vertical movement gesture.|`zoom` `exposureCorrection` `none`|

    app:cameraGestureTap="focus|focusWithMarker|capture|none"
    app:cameraGestureLongTap="focus|focusWithMarker|capture|none"
    app:cameraGestureScrollHorizontal="zoom|exposureCorrection|none"
    app:cameraGestureScrollVertical="zoom|exposureCorrection|none"/>
