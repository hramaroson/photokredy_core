*This is a new major version (v2) of the library. It includes breaking changes, signature changes and new functionality.
Keep reading if interested, or head to the legacy-v1 branch to read v1 documentation and info.*

*The v2 version is still in beta and its API surface might still change. Functions might be renamed,
options might be removed (though they probably won't), signatures might change. If this is a problem,
please wait for the final release and keep using v1*.
